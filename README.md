## Using a recurrent bidirectional LSTM neural network model to classify road and traffic sample images
Obtained an accuracy of 93% and 91% after 25 stages on the validation and testing dataset respectively. Model similar to many image recognition used in big automobile cooperation in the development of self driving cars
RGB images were preprocessed to standardized dataset and then fed into a bidirectional LSTM model rather than conventional convolutional neural networks.
