## Using a recurrent bidirectional LSTM neural network model to classify road and traffic sample images
Obtained an accuracy of 98%, 93% and 91% on the training, validation and testing dataset respectively. 
Similar to many image classifiers used in big automobile cooperations in development of self driving cars, RGB images were preprocessed to standardize dataset and then fed into a bidirectional LSTM model rather than conventional convolutional neural networks using a tanh activation function.
